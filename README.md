Following are the Artificial Intelligence agents for games 


## [Kalaha AI-Agent](https://github.com/Chost-97/AI/blob/master/Kalaha/src/ai/AIClient.java) using Minimax with Depth-First search and Alpha-Beta pruning stopping at a pre-defined depth level (>4)

 When AI agent has to make the move, Kalaha game state is cloned and the possible scores for each possible move(node) with scores are taken initially and iteratively calculate the scores for the next possible nodes from the initial nodes up to a depth of 4. The min-max is generated for each node along with the alph-beta pruning, which is applied using depth first search. The agent outputs the inital move(node) for the Kalaha game on behalf of AI agent with the max profit.
